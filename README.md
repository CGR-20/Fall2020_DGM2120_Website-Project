Project from UVU Fall 2020 DGM 2120 that demonstrates a website created using HTML and CSS. The website can be anything we want, and so I chose to create a store-based site that includes various things such as:

* audio (.mp3, .ogg) files
* images (.png, .jpg)
* other files (.pdf)
* videos implemented via Youtube links
* map via Google Maps
