                <blockquote>
                    At first, the website didn't seem to be all that great and professional, and it didn't help that there wasn't 
                    much to buy. But as I kept looking through the site, it became clear that it was definitely well-made and had thought
                    put into it. Wouldn't mind visiting again.

                <p>Despite being a techno-centric store, there are certain things that we
                do not offer on this website. Some of those things include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Kitchen Appliances</li>
                    <li>Lawn Appliances</li>
                    <li>Construction Equipment</li>
                    <li>Home Appliances such as vacuum cleaners</li>
                    <li>Monitors or televisions</li>
                </ul>

                    <dt>Operating System</dt>
                    <dd>These are what allow users like you to manipulate and control your device, and also determine
                    what you see. Various OS like iOS and Windows function differently and thus, you must be careful in
                    selecting what OS feels comfortable for you.</dd>

                    <dt>Hardware</dt>
                    <dd>Another thing to keep in mind other than the software and OS is what the devices physical contain.
                    Different devices, even those build by the same manufacturer, may or may not contain specific features 
                    such as the number of usb ports and bluetooth.</dd>

                    <dt>Storage</dt>
                    <dd>Nowadays it's important to know the difference between MB (megabytes), GB (gigabytes) and their 
                    variations. This helps you determine how much data a given device can hold, and which is right for you.</dd>
